### Wrapper/proxy correctness

When the PR adds or modifies a type that wraps another (cache, proxy, decorator,
adapter): check that every method routes to the wrapped instance and not back
through a registry/session/global — e.g. a caching provider holding a
`delegate` field that resolves IDs via `session.get(...)` instead of
`delegate.get(...)` will re-enter the cache or recurse. Also check that the
wrapper forwards all the methods the callers actually use.
